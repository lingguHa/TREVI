IATA airline designators, sometimes called <u>IATA reservation codes</u>, are <strong>two-character codes</strong> assigned by the International Air Transport Association (<a href="https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EA%B5%AD%EC%A0%9C_%ED%95%AD%EA%B3%B5_%EC%9A%B4%EC%86%A1_%ED%98%91%ED%9A%8C" target="_blank" title="IATA specification">IATA</a>) to the world's airlines. <br>The standard is described in IATA's Standard Schedules Information Manual and the codes themselves are described in IATA's Airline Coding Directory.<p>The IATA codes were originally based on the ICAO designators which were issued in 1947 as two-letter airline identification codes (see the section below). IATA expanded the two-character-system with codes consisting of a letter and a digit (or vice versa) e.g. EasyJet's U2 after ICAO had introduced its current three-letter-system in 1982. Until then only combinations of letters were used.</P><p>Airline designator codes follow the format xx(a), i.e., two alphanumeric characters (letters or digits) followed by an optional letter. Although the IATA standard provides for three-character airline designators, IATA has not used the optional third character in any assigned code. This is because some legacy computer systems, especially the "central reservations systems", have failed to comply with the standard, notwithstanding the fact that it has been in place for twenty years. The codes issued to date comply with IATA Resolution 762, which provides for only two characters. These codes thus comply with the current airline designator standard, but use only a limited subset of its possible range.</P>
